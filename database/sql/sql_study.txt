QUERY CLAUSES:

* Select: determine which fields to include in the result set
* From: determine which tables to get data from (can be more than one, when they are joined)
* Where: defines filters to filter out unwanted data, commonly by field values.
* Group By: used to group records together based on field values.
* Having: Filters out unwanted groups
* Order By: text sorting, based on field values.

SELECT:

* basic: SELECT fields FROM table

* the optional DISTINCT modifier: goes right after the SELECT keyword. this will eliminate duplicate records.
* example: "which cities are represented by our bowling membership?" -> SELECT city FROM bowlers. this might yield multiple ocurrences of a city if theres two
members in the same city.
* so changing that to a SELECT DISTINCT city FROM bowlers will remove the duplicate records.

* ORDER BY: comes after the table. this is used to specify the field used to sort the result set.
* example: SELECT city, date_registered FROM customers ORDER BY city ASC/DESC
* it is possible to include multiple fields as the sorting subjects. they are evaluated from left to right.
