* checkout http://www.w3.org/
* what goes what how and where? the TCP packet goes inside the IP packets payload, right? and IP packets go inside ethernet/wifi frames, right? answer: PRECISELY!

sandboxes:
* Wat about when listening on a socket? Do you select the transport layer of the socket?
* ask stackoverflow: some tcp sockets usage examples and some udp sockets usage examples.
* ask stackoverflow: can you connect() on udp sockets?
* ask stackoverflow: can you timeout on a udp socket? no, right? you cant even connect in the first place, right? (connection-less, no guarantees)
* Porta servidor e porta cliente sao assimetricas (connect porta 80 remota, outgoing local porta can be anything?)

* sandbox: can I listen and connect at the same time? same ports too?

* do a miniserver and nc to it, for testing. try running the server with netbeans+debugger, run nc, see if a breakpoint is triggered at the listen() function.
* sandbox: try keep a server and a client on with TCP - see if they ever timeout. if they do, try implementing some very crude keep alive mechanism - then test again.

* networks sandbox: setup a miniserver, listening on some port. then try to have two clients connect on that same port. is it possible? ifnot (atleast not that easily), then how can webservers
 keep listening on port 80 for everyone?

* network sandbox: try to do something like udp-based discovery (a-la dns/dhcp finding) - broadcast with udp, possible somehow? or multicast?
* net sniffing sandboxes
* Webdev: do some html form post to php and get and process sandbox

* ask stackoverflow: what is the ideal packet size for tcp/udp?
* when the NIC "posts" something on the cable, it has no idea where it's going, right? is there a "destination MAC address"? or only the network layer routes/decides ownership and such?

book/later:
* JSP? is it like PHP? do you embed it in HTML code?? <?jsp anyone ??
* handmade email - checkout POP and SNMP SMTP whatever

donedeals/futureref:
* look around youtube videos: how do vpns work in detail? ip packet encapsulation?
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69Ngf8rips
* ask stackoverflow: what is a gateway anyway?
* checkout some http/ftp protocols youtube videos
* tcp and udp packets in detail
* http protocol
* checkout even more applayer protocols
