ADRESSOF
* c++ allows the overloading of the single ampersand operator, thus making the class non-addressable. there's a workaround for that: addressof, check boost

CLIENT-ATTORNEY (reduce access to a class by their friends)
* three classes, client, attorney and counterparty.
* client is friends with attorney, and has only private methods (and therefore only itself and attorney can access)
* attorney is friends with counterparty, and also has private members that interface with client
* counterparty can only access client through the attorney
