This is a typical hello world.
C++ is a strongly typed and statically typed language.
All industry-standard implementations of C++ are compiled to native programs.

Main uses: applications/back-ends of all scales, but mainly medium and large, where performance is important or critical.
Multiparadigm: imperative, object oriented, generic (by means of templates) and functional (starting at C++11)
Backwards compatible with C
