STD::FUNCTION (STD::TR1::FUNCTION)
this lets out bind artifacts with compatible signatures to generic contexts (pre-reference a function pointer OR a function object); very clever. allows for generic Stratgey pattern.

STD::VECTOR
guarantees to mantain its internal memory in a consistent sequence (in the actual memory)
they are the gateway to C ABI.
